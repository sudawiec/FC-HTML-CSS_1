## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties(variables)

### What I learned

- Usage of the :nth-of-type() selector with (odd) and (even) keywords

```css
.person:nth-of-type(odd) {
  margin-bottom: 2.33em;
}
.person:nth-of-type(even) {
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
```

- CSS transitions which allows me to change property values smoothly, over a given duration

```css
.box {
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
```

- The transform property which let me rotate, scale, skew, and translate an element

```css
.box:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Continued development

The next step I'm going to focus on:

- Creating a hamburger menu button
- Learning more about cubic-bezier() function
